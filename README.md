# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Docker Setup

This project is configured to run with Docker, allowing for both development and production environments.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- The backend API should be running in a Docker container connected to the 'poker-network' network

### Docker Commands

#### Development Mode

```bash
# Start the development server with hot-reload
npm run docker:dev
```

This will:

- Build and run the React app in development mode
- Mount your local files to enable hot-reloading
- Connect to the backend API via the Docker network
- Expose the app on http://localhost:3000

#### Production Mode

```bash
# Build the production image
npm run docker:build

# Start the production container
npm run docker:prod
```

This will:

- Build an optimized production version of the app
- Serve it using Nginx
- Configure API proxying
- Expose the app on port 80 (http://localhost)

### Container Structure

- Development: Uses Node.js Alpine to run the development server
- Production: Builds the app with Node.js and serves it with Nginx
- The Nginx configuration handles React routing and proxies API requests to the backend

### Environment Configuration

- Development: Uses variables from `.env.development`
- Production: Uses variables baked into the image during build
- API URL is configured to connect to the backend service
